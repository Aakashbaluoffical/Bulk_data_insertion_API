User Data API - Bulk Data Insertion
===================================
This project aims to create a Django RestFramework API for inserting user data from a .csv file into a database with validation checks. The API validates various fields like email, age, username, and password to ensure that the data being inserted is accurate and meets the required criteria.

=============
    first_name,last_name,age,email,username,password
    Alice,Smith,29,alice.smith@example.com,alicesmith,securepassword
    Bob,Johnson,35,bob.johnson@example.com,bobjohnson,anotherpassword
    Charlie,Lee,23,charlie.lee@example.com,charlielee,password1234

Testing the API
=============
You can test the API using Postman or any other API testing tool:

URL: 

    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload/

Method: POST

Body: Choose the file from your local machine and upload the .csv file.

Example .env File

DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://your-database-url
Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual data. The DATABASE_URL can be any supported database URL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).

Truncate incase of wrong data inserted
===================================
    TRUNCATE TABLE user_tbl RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
    TRUNCATE TABLE user_profile_tbl RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

.env contains
==============
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://your-database-url  
    SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-de8
    DEBUG=True # Set to False in production
